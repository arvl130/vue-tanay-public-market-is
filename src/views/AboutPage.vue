        The <span class="font-bold">Tanay Public Market</span> (TPM) is situated
        1.3 kilometers south of Laguna Lake in Sitio Pasipit, Barangay Plaza
        Aldea, away from the town's municipal building. It was established in
        1994 to replace the original public market site close to Tanay Church,
        which was burned down the same year. The property is 3.0 hectares in
        size and is flanked on all sides by commercial establishments.
        Commodities were divided into sections and buildings, as follows: Dry
        Section - Bldgs. Wet Section - Cl and C1 (part of), A, B1 & B2 & C2
        (part of), to give market-goers/consumers a sense of organization and
        direction. According to data provided by the Municipal Treasury Office,
        the 2020 income of Tanay Public Market decreased by 32.64 percent due to
        the suspension of payments of rental fees on fixed stalls, commercial
        stalls, ambulant vendors, terminal fees, and other fees being
        implemented in the public market, due to the effects of the pandemic on
        market vendors and other users of the facilities within the public
        market.
